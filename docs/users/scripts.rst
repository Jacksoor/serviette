Scripts
=======

Script commands are written by users and can be run by typing ``.<command name>`` (or whatever the script command prefix is instead of ``.``).

To find out information about any script, you can use the ``$command`` command:

::

    $command <command name>

If you are looking to write your own scripts, the :ref:`scripting documentation <scripting>` contains a reference guide.

Security
--------

Make sure you understand what scripts can and cannot do before running your first script.

**Scripts can:**

 * Collect information about you such as your username and what server and channel you ran the script on.

**Scripts cannot:**

 * Steal your private personal details.

 * Know what websites you are visiting.

 * Perform anything outside of interacting with your chat user.

Scripts are not screened for safety and they may be malicious!
