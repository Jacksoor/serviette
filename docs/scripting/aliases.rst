Aliases
=======

Aliases allow for the shortening of qualified command names (``<account handle>/<script name>``) to short names (``<alias>``).

Aliases are granted on a prepaid short-term lease, and may be bought via the web interface. While you hold the lease to the alias, its target may be changed to any command you own.
